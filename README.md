After checking existing options and publish/subscribing systems this isn't a worth while endevear. Will leave up as an example of a concurrent structure at work

# Mulitprocessing example 

Extending process for our class which implements a subcriber model. Logging events are pushed to a queue which the logging process then puses to a file. Main just throws a deliberate error  

Looking to treat logs as an event strean going forward
